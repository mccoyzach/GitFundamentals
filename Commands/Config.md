# git config

When first setting up git, you'll need to work with the gir config commands in order to set up your identity.

For example, your identity can be set up with the commands such as:
...

git config --global user.name "zach mccoy"
git config --global user.email zachmccoy2021@gmail.com
...

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
